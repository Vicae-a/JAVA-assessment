# üçΩÔ∏è Simple Restaurant Seating System

Welcome! This is a **simple Java program** that simulates how a restaurant assigns tables to customers. It follows **real-world rules** like seating groups together, managing waiting lines, and prioritizing smaller groups when possible.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Program Does

- The restaurant has **tables of different sizes** (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 seats).
- Customers **arrive alone or in groups** (up to 6 people).
- If a suitable table is available, the group is **seated immediately**.
- If no table is available, the group **waits in line** (queue).
- **Smaller groups** can be seated before larger waiting groups **if space allows**.
- Once seated, **a group cannot switch tables**.
- If a group waits too long, they may **leave the queue** without being served.

## üìÇ How This Program is Organized

This project contains **three main Java files**:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Table.java** ‚Äì Represents each table in the restaurant.
- Stores the **table size** and **occupied seats**.
- Checks if a group can be seated.
- Updates seating when a group arrives or leaves.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ RestManager.java** ‚Äì Manages tables and the waiting queue.
- Keeps track of **all tables** in the restaurant.
- Decides where to **seat new groups**.
- Manages the **waiting list** if no tables are available.
- Makes sure seating rules are followed.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ RestaurantSimulation.java** ‚Äì Runs the program.
- Accepts **user input** (new customers arriving, groups leaving, etc.).
- Calls `RestManager` to **process seating and queue**.
- Displays **the current status of tables**.

## üîß Features to Add in the Future
This is a simple version, but we can improve it by adding:
- **Time-based system** (so groups leave if they wait too long).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** (so it's easier to use).
- **Better table management** (to reduce waiting time).
